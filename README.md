# Emotion Classifier
The Emotion Classifier is a web-based application that predicts emotions from uploaded images using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This project integrates a complete machine learning pipeline with a user-friendly web interface, showcasing skills in frontend development, backend API design, and machine learning deployment.

## Features
**Image Upload**: Users can upload an image directly through the app's interface.
**Emotion Classification**: Predicts the emotion depicted in the uploaded image using a pre-trained CNN model.
**Seamless Integration**: Combines React.js for the frontend, Flask for the backend, and a machine learning model for inference.
